Pattern_Recognition
===================

Use Histogram and Parzen Window for 2D dataset to estimate Kenrnel Density Estimation and Plot Figure 3D for Pattern Recognition\
add dataset seprate x,y \
estimaate Histogram and Parzen WIndow with (start point and end point) , (Bin width), (H) , (P_W) and Draw It\
Next Estimate Kernel Density and Plot 3D figure with (x , y , KDE)
